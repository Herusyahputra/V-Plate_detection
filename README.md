# Vehicle Plate Detection from Different Angle By a Single Fisheye Camera
========================================================================================

## Introduction

This is an application for the implementation of vehicle plate detection experiments using multi views from a single fisheye camera. Which aims to provide a solution from the development of many cameras installed on the road to monitor vehicles. This application is one example of the development of moilutils-templates from Ming-chi Omnidirectional Imaging and Laboratory.. 


## Attention
To use the YoloV4 that has been trained, you can download the model provided at this link ["YoloV4 Model"](https://mcut-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/m09158023_o365_mcut_edu_tw/EtHEDclopVtBq9Yspxe1t-UBGfTv-IjtpwMUD8B4b6YopQ?e=19bhOt).
